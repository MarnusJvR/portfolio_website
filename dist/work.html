                    <h3>Data & business Analytics Project: Student Retention</h3>
                    <p>
                        In January of 2020 I got contracted by a company in the education sector to conduct a research project with the wide project scope of identifying the reason/reasons for low student retention rates. After a prelim investigation a hypothesis was drafted stating that bad student grades was most likely the biggest driver of low student retention. Thousands of data-points were gathered, and the hypothesis was proven with a strong level of confidence. Thanks to algoritms based analyses, further very interesting patterns were identified in the data. The company has since implemented several measures based on my findings.

                        <h3>Automated Data Extraction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The brief for this assignment was simple, however the solution was not. The company utilized a management system that carried all of their data. Due to a change in operating procedures, the need arose to issue individual customer statements. The system could not do this, and we could only extract raw data in pdf format. We had no access to the data banks directly. I developed a Python script that extracted the finance data from PDF files and generated individual statements. this project had a high level of complexity and also presented a steep learning curve.

                                I was lead project manager on this 27 million rand community upliftment initiative. The project saw great success in partnership with Royal Bafokeng Platinum, with 300 unemployed beneficiaries being trained in a combination of hard-skill accredited programs. The project concluded with the placement of 288 beneficiaries in workplaces linked to mining activities.  I was also responsible for sourcing of the project funds, In addition to the operational management of the project.

                            <p>
                               In partnership with a senior JS developer, we developed Rabit Chat: A rolete video chat service that randomly partner users and place them into a video chat room together. This awesome app was developed using Redux for state management and hosted with google firebase. During the nationwide lock-down I also assisted restuarant owners by developing an online order system in vanilla JS that was free for use. Currently, I am busy developing a fully functional MIS for a company that will be able to automate operational activities, invoicing and generation of monthly management reports.

                            <p>
                              I assisted a prominent Proprietary Fund in analyzing bulk financial market data and identifying trends. The purpose of the project was to identify possible trade strategies that could yield possitive results specifically on Mondays when market conditions is considered as volitile. I develop Python scripts that managed to prove a specific hypothesis on Monday market movement, that resulted in the implimentation of a new profitable trade strategy. I also assisted in developing ML algorithms that assess live market conditions and advise traders on the probibility of profit or loss for every specific trade before the trade is made.
