                    <h3>Data & business Analytics Project: Student Retention</h3>
                    <p>
                        In January of 2020 I got contracted by a company in the education sector to conduct a research project with the wide project scope of identifying the reason/reasons for low student retention rates. After a prelim investigation a hypothesis was drafted stating that bad student grades was most likely the biggest driver of low student retention. Thousands of data-points were gathered, and the hypothesis was proven with a strong level of confidence. Thanks to algoritms based analyses, further very interesting patterns were identified in the data. The company has since implemented several measures based on my findings.

                        <h3>Automated Data Extraction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The brief for this assignment was simple, however the solution was not. The company utilized a management system that carried all of their data. Due to a change in operating procedures, the need arose to issue individual customer statements. The system could not do this, and we could only extract raw data in pdf format. We had no access to the data banks directly. I developed a Python script that extracted the finance data from PDF files and generated individual statements. This project had a high level of complexity and also presented a steep learning curve.

                                I was lead project manager on this 27 million rand community upliftment initiative. The project saw great success in partnership with Royal Bafokeng Platinum, with 300 unemployed beneficiaries being trained in a combination of hard-skill accredited programs. The project concluded with the placement of 288 beneficiaries in workplaces linked to mining activities.  I was also responsible for sourcing of the project funds, in addition to the operational management of the project.

                            <p>
                              In January 2020 I was contracted by a prominent proprietary fund to assist in data analytics projects aimed at financial markets. As lead of data analytics, I am mainly responsible for testing hypothesis developed by in-house economists and financial traders and determining the viability and risks associated with the implementation of related strategies. Furthermore, I am also responsible in identifying complimentary trends in the data and advise on possible previous unseen implications and opportunities.  I am proud to say that during my work with the proprietary fund I manged to identify trends and prove hypothesis previously completely unknown to the academic world, and I am now in the process of publishing my findings.

                            <h3>Web App Development</h3>
                            <p>
                               In partnership with a senior JS developer, we developed Rabit Chat: A rolete video chat service that randomly partner users and place them into a video chat room together. This awesome app was developed using Redux for state management and hosted with google firebase. During the nationwide lock-down I also assisted restuarant owners by developing an online order system in vanilla JS that was free for use. Currently, I am busy developing a fully functional MIS for a company that will be able to automate operational activities, invoicing and generation of monthly management reports.

                            <p>
                              As part of my portfolio as lead of data analytics with the proprietary fund I developed a basic  Machine Learning algorithm that analysis several data points and determines a profit / loss probability on a specific trade before the trader places the trade. This is utilized as an additional guidance tool given to traders to attempt to mitigate risk factors
